# Agricultural Production Statistics Dashboard
This repository contains the code for the creation of an interactive dashboard. The dashboard was created using the panel / holoviz framework.
The dashboard visualizes agricultural production statistics grouped by continents since 1960 until today. 

Data source: Our World In Data.
